description: |
  Hightail is an automatic tester for programming contests such as 
  CodeForces rounds. It will parse the problem statement, extract 
  sample test cases (inputs and outputs) from it, and verify the 
  correctness of your program against them. It is built to provide 
  maximum automation and to relieve the contestant as much as possible.
